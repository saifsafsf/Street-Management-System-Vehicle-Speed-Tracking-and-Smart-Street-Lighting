# Street-Management-System-Vehicle-Speed-Tracking-and-Smart-Street-Lighting
This project elucidates the implementation of Smart Street Management System, which includes an automated Smart Street Lighting System followed by implementation of an innovative Vehicle Speed Detection system. 

### Smart Street Lighting
It involves lights that adapt to surrounding illumination and operate by motion detection. The circuit is based on light intensity detection, under low illumination, the resistance of the LDR falls allowing current to flow through the circuit and whenever motion is detected, the LEDs light up.

### Vehicle Speed Detection
This project presents a system, developed for over-speeding detection and alerting offenders as well as authorities automatically. In this work, it has been proved that automation provides efficient performance compared to a human handled system.
